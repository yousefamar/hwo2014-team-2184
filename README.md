## kill -9 bot

Out to win it, dattebayo.

[Tech specs](https://helloworldopen.com/techspec)
for most recent information. We won't be updating this document in your codebase :)

We're told not to modify the scripts on the main level, because CI servers.

- `./build` - build the bot, i.e. prepare for running
- `./run <host> <port> [<botname>]` - run the bot synchronously.

The HWO servers build the bots *offline*. No internet. If you need something
else, it better be checked in.

The CI runs "regularly".
